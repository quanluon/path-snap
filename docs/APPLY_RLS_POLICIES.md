# üîê Apply RLS Policies to Supabase

## ‚úÖ Database Migration Applied
The database schema has been updated with RLS policies.

## üöÄ Next Steps - Apply RLS Policies

### **Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard**
1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ydfbvdbjcjeofxlxtheq`
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

### **Step 2: Run RLS Policies**
Copy and paste this SQL into the SQL Editor and run it:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users table policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles" ON users
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON users
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON users
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Images table policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view images" ON images
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert images" ON images
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own images" ON images
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images" ON images
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Plans table policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view plans" ON plans
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own plans" ON plans
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own plans" ON plans
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own plans" ON plans
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Reactions table policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view reactions" ON reactions
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert reactions" ON reactions
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reactions" ON reactions
FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own reactions" ON reactions
FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Storage policies for checkpoint-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'checkpoint-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload for images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'checkpoint-images' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'checkpoint-images' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'checkpoint-images' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### **Step 3: Test the App**
After running the SQL:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/upload
2. Try uploading a photo
3. It should work perfectly! üéâ

## üîê What These Policies Do

### **Database Tables**
- ‚úÖ **Public read access** - Anyone can view images, plans, reactions
- ‚úÖ **Authenticated uploads** - Only logged-in users can create content
- ‚úÖ **User ownership** - Users can only modify their own content
- ‚úÖ **Secure by default** - RLS prevents unauthorized access

### **Storage Bucket**
- ‚úÖ **Public read access** - Anyone can view uploaded images
- ‚úÖ **Authenticated uploads** - Only logged-in users can upload
- ‚úÖ **User ownership** - Users can only modify their own files
- ‚úÖ **Secure file access** - Proper file permissions

## üéØ **Result**
After applying these policies, your Checkpoint app will have:
- ‚úÖ **Secure uploads** - Only authenticated users can upload
- ‚úÖ **Public viewing** - Anyone can view images without login
- ‚úÖ **User privacy** - Users can only modify their own content
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** - Proper security policies in place

The upload error should be completely resolved! üöÄ
